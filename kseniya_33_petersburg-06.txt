Dear Kseniya,  

Your generosity is exceptional and betokens a great and noble heart, an aristocratic heart in fact.  Modern people do not appreciate that true aristocratic heart is never demeaning and denigrating but always benevolent and kind and with lilting grace that uplifts all of humanity. Your exceptionally kind words are a reflection of your inner beauty and I appreciate this quite well.  I do believe that I am living this life to fulfill a great mission, to find for each person on this world their soul mate.  When I was much younger, and less able to distinguish deep substance from the glistering things that are ephemeral i thought differently, but now I no longer live for the praise of the external world but to have a meaningful death, and to transform the world of human race better for my short stay here.  You are a great and noble soul.  With love, Zulf
