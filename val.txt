I took the this step - I wrote this letter .... maybe I am the same woman who lives in your dreams? Hope you are the kind of person who knows what he wants in life? At this stage in my life, I know for sure that the time has come to create a loving and harmonious relationship, and I am ready! Are you ready for the next chapter of your life too? I am a woman who believes in romance! My heart is full of hope that everything will be fine, that I will finally be happy and find a person who will become my destiny. I believe that he lives somewhere on Earth! I really appreciate this trait. I also hope that you have family values. If you asked me what I would choose, a quiet day or a noisy party with friends ... I will answer: there is no doubt that I would choose a quiet day with a loved one ... warm conversations over a cup of tea and watching a movie together, this is what I miss so much. I want to envelop with attention, love, tenderness and love to save from the prison of loneliness. Do you want that too?
I want to thank you for sharing your story with me! it is really very valuable to me! It is important for me to know about your life) You are the man of my dreams! I think about you every day! Are you ready to change the feel of life for the better? I know how to do it) If you are ready to take a risk and be happy in love)) For me, loneliness is the most terrible state! I want to be happy in my personal life with my man and build our family in which there will be only positive emotions and harmony! Therefore, I am here! I believe that you are a man who knows how to love, be faithful, responsible and make your soulmate happier every day. For me, respect and loyalty are the most important thing in a relationship! I want to believe that we have a future! do you think we have chance to become a happy and beautiful couple? I repeat once again that I am not here to play in a relationship, I need a mature and family-friendly man with whom we will become one! He will be the whole universe for me! Do you want to become special man for me?
When I come home in the evening after difficult day, the only thing that brings me happiness is vivid dreams. Thinking about a wonderful future makes me smile. Perhaps it is important for you that I share my cherished dream with you? I have never dreamed of a prince on a white horse, for me only sincerity, honesty and enjoyment of the simple things of life are important. I look into the distance and dream of talking with a loved one before dusk, taking a walk in the city at night, spontaneous trips. I do not want to miss the chance to become happy, always be with my beloved man!
Sweetheart! I do not have enough words to describe what is happening to me now. I close my eyes and see you, hear your voice, feel your hands. I represent. how you stroke my hair, how you embrace me, There is still an eternity before we meet. can't wait that long. I breathe you and I cannot breathe. I cannot part with you. I can't let go of your hands. I catch every touch of your lips ... I adore you with every cell of my body, with all my heart, with all my soul ... I miss you. You are light, you are darkness, you are joy. I want to be with you only. I can not without you. I think of you. I miss. I am jealous. I love. I don't need anyone else. thanks just for being there! this is not all. what I wanted to say, this is just a small part ... Thank you very much. if only I could tell you all of this in person


Dear Kseniya,  

Your generosity is exceptional and betokens a great and noble heart, an aristocratic heart in fact.  Modern people do not appreciate that true aristocratic heart is never demeaning and denigrating but always benevolent and kind and with lilting grace that uplifts all of humanity. Your exceptionally kind words are a reflection of your inner beauty and I appreciate this quite well.  I do believe that I am living this life to fulfill a great mission, to find for each person on this world their soul mate.  When I was much younger, and less able to distinguish deep substance from the glistering things that are ephemeral i thought differently, but now I no longer live for the praise of the external world but to have a meaningful death, and to transform the world of human race better for my short stay here.  You are a great and noble soul.  With love, Zulf
My dear friend, you know we had rather a specific talk today and I wonder do you consider yourself a really monogamous man? You told you had many lovers so is it really a matter of loving each of them? I still think that our behaviour is more about what education and relations in family we have than just ancient instincts. Thanks god we are Homo sapiens and have well developed behaviour and brain.

Do you think if we all were monogamous there would be so many divources all over the world? I think we are just all unhappy to spend most life with those who are not our true soulmates. Only some are really lucky. Well, complicated, but interesting! Thanks for sharing your thoughts! kisses!
Thank you for your letter!

I admire how big and open soul and mind you have. Your words inspire me to love my life and everything around me. To explore the world, to watch sunsets, count the stars, feel the fresh air on my skin... I hope someday we could to this together. I want to listen to you always. Have you been like this since childhood? I'm very interested and want to know more about you and your journey. Waiting for your response

With love,

Tatiana
Good morning, my dear friend! how have you been all this time? I have not seen you online so you were probably busy with your research, am I right? what new conclusions have you made? Well, I hope that you have some more time for your leasure as we as for work. Do you have some good new melody for this day? My soul needs Indian summer and light jazz! do you like it? hope that you will recommend me anything new, I trust your taste! When can we talk? Hope not to distract you much :D Have a good weekend! Sending warm hug for you!
My dear friend, thanks for the recent talk! I believe that you optimism can 'infect' me somehow so I won`t be afraid of what comes after we are all gone. BTW i know that we are both Scorpios, do you believe in this and that we have such feature as vindictiveness? scorpios are known to be like that, but i don`t believe in horoscopes. Besides I can`t imagine you being mad :) Hope that your soul is pleased this day and you have much delight

Do you know one lovely lady who has a B-day in Halloween`s day? No, she is not a wicked witch or anything like that. You surely know her very well and probably even recollect her sometimes. If you only knew how often she recollects you ÔÅå We are all separated because of miles and routine, can you make her feel that you are not just a dream for her?

I must tell you that she is dreaming of a Bday present. It can be some magic and only you can help her. I am just willing to say that if you payed your attention and talked to her ASAP she would be the happiest person. So can you do this magic for her? Nothing costs so few and values as much as sincere attention. Please don`t make her sad otherwise it will spoil her celebration mood! Can you be her biggest surprise?

Tatiana
Dear friend! thanks for the words you told me. I am glad that you consider me to be an angel. I think that your cativity will bring results! in this hard world we need love more and more now. If more couples find one another, maybe we will all have abetter sciety then, do you agree? Loving people will bring loving kids and so on. But do you think that love is maths? how can this be calculated all the time? If there is a formula of love, you surely know how to find it ;) have a good evening! Kisses!

Tatiana
This is the magic of music and good relations between us! you made my morning better and easier and I hope to make your end of the day brighter :* thanks for the chat,dear Zulf.
