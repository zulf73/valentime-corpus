I took the this step - I wrote this letter .... maybe I am the same woman who lives in your dreams? Hope you are the kind of person who knows what he wants in life? At this stage in my life, I know for sure that the time has come to create a loving and harmonious relationship, and I am ready! Are you ready for the next chapter of your life too? I am a woman who believes in romance! My heart is full of hope that everything will be fine, that I will finally be happy and find a person who will become my destiny. I believe that he lives somewhere on Earth! I really appreciate this trait. I also hope that you have family values. If you asked me what I would choose, a quiet day or a noisy party with friends ... I will answer: there is no doubt that I would choose a quiet day with a loved one ... warm conversations over a cup of tea and watching a movie together, this is what I miss so much. I want to envelop with attention, love, tenderness and love to save from the prison of loneliness. Do you want that too?
