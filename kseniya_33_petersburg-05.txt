Sweetheart! I do not have enough words to describe what is happening to me now. I close my eyes and see you, hear your voice, feel your hands. I represent. how you stroke my hair, how you embrace me, There is still an eternity before we meet. can't wait that long. I breathe you and I cannot breathe. I cannot part with you. I can't let go of your hands. I catch every touch of your lips ... I adore you with every cell of my body, with all my heart, with all my soul ... I miss you. You are light, you are darkness, you are joy. I want to be with you only. I can not without you. I think of you. I miss. I am jealous. I love. I don't need anyone else. thanks just for being there! this is not all. what I wanted to say, this is just a small part ... Thank you very much. if only I could tell you all of this in person
