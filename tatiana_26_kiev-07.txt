This is the magic of music and good relations between us! you made my morning better and easier and I hope to make your end of the day brighter :* thanks for the chat,dear Zulf. You know U2 has always been associated with the Elevation song for me, I did not know they have such a deep composition. This is what close people do to one another-help to discover new things for inspiration and I thank you for this. Wish you a good night and let your dream be as delighted as your mind after listening to the fav song..your heart beats special to me :*
