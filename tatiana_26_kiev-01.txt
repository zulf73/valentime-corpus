My dear friend, you know we had rather a specific talk today and I wonder do you consider yourself a really monogamous man? You told you had many lovers so is it really a matter of loving each of them? I still think that our behaviour is more about what education and relations in family we have than just ancient instincts. Thanks god we are Homo sapiens and have well developed behaviour and brain.

Do you think if we all were monogamous there would be so many divources all over the world? I think we are just all unhappy to spend most life with those who are not our true soulmates. Only some are really lucky. Well, complicated, but interesting! Thanks for sharing your thoughts! kisses!
