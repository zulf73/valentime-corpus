Do you know one lovely lady who has a B-day in Halloween`s day? No, she is not a wicked witch or anything like that. You surely know her very well and probably even recollect her sometimes. If you only knew how often she recollects you ÔÅå We are all separated because of miles and routine, can you make her feel that you are not just a dream for her?

I must tell you that she is dreaming of a Bday present. It can be some magic and only you can help her. I am just willing to say that if you payed your attention and talked to her ASAP she would be the happiest person. So can you do this magic for her? Nothing costs so few and values as much as sincere attention. Please don`t make her sad otherwise it will spoil her celebration mood! Can you be her biggest surprise?
